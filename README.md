## Set Video Speed
This extension let you set any positive arbitrary number on the first video element of a page. The code can theoretically work on any site but restricted to work only on YouTube.

Note: This is a quick and dirty extension I made for fast-forwarding long conference videos on YouTube because stock YouTube player does not let me set a custom playback rate like 1.125. **USE AT OWN RISK**
